problem ?

1-start with a big project like number of components or element are huge
for example e-commerce store ===>like context api
solution is state mangment 

problem is also prop drilling we are discuss last class context api
2-when we have a lot of components that need to access the same state 
solution is also redux
you dont use stata in root level like app you are store your store


Redux Arecture

react-redux vs redux-toolkit
we are perfer redux toolkit all is depericate not longer avillable
========================
store ==== varilable data storage
 reducer   ===== reducer help we are change the state a =20  then a=21 abilty of change the state the help of reducer we are perform add del etc...
action & state ====== triger point we are click than reducer is active like add to cart button inc or dec button than start state manupilation
